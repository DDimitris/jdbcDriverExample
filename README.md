# JDBC Driver simple example

This is a simple example of how the jdbc driver can be used. The project contains an example .sql database that holds
basic info about persons (e.g. First name, last name, phone). The user is able to read / write to the database through a 
minimal graphical interface. The database name, the username and the password are read from the .xml file so the user must fill 
in his credentials in order to connect to the database. The source code was written based on the **MVC design pattern**.
